# propertiesAndDotNotation
Created with CodeSandbox
I created an empty object. Then, I used dot notation to add properties to my object using key-value pairs. I also modified the properties by changing the value of one property and removing an element from an array. Finally, I added text on the web page and hid a class.

At the top of the starter code, please notice the two selectors pointing towards the "topic" and "count" classes that are styling two hidden paragraphs. My final result is that the JS will reveal those paragraphs!
